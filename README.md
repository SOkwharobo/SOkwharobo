# 👋 Hey, I'm Solomon Okwharobo!

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I’m a mathematician turned data enthusiast, currently diving headfirst into the fascinating world of Machine Learning. I’ve got a solid background in crunching numbers and making sense of data, but when it comes to ML, I’m just getting started—and loving every minute of it!

## 🎓 My Story So Far
- **Math Whiz**: I’ve always had a thing for numbers, which led me to a degree in mathematics. It taught me how to think logically and tackle problems with precision.
- **Data Geek**: I’ve spent time as a Data Analyst at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), where I wrangled data, built dashboards, and extracted insights like a pro. Power BI and Python are my go-to tools.
- **ML Newbie**: Now, I’m on an exciting journey to master machine learning. I’m working on projects that involve predictive modeling, data cleaning, and experimenting with algorithms. It’s a steep learning curve, but I’m all in!

## 🚀 What Gets Me Excited
I’m all about learning and pushing the boundaries of what I can do with data. Whether it’s finding patterns in datasets or tinkering with new ML models, I’m driven by curiosity and a passion for solving real-world problems.

## 🛠 Skills & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, VBA (because who doesn’t love a good script?)
- **Data Science & ML**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Power BI
- **Backend Stuff**: Django, RESTful APIs, PostgreSQL

## 🤝 Let’s Connect!
I’m always up for a chat, whether it’s about data, machine learning, or just geeking out over cool tech. Check out my projects, hit me up on LinkedIn, or drop me a message. Let’s learn, build, and create something awesome together!
